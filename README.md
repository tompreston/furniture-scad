# Furniture SCAD
Some furniture/room mock ups for the new house.

## Tips/lessons:
- Build modules relative to 0,0,0, then translate into place later.
- Dimensions are measured length (across), width (away), height (up).
- This matches to y, x, z here.
- Dimensions are also relative, so no necessarily x, y, z.
- Use functions to represent dimensions
